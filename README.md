## 👁 **Who I Am**

I am **Angelo “Polkin Rishall” Hurley** — a systems thinker, myth-engineer, and creative technologist working at the intersection of:

- AI systems architecture  
- cultural anthropology  
- narrative theory  
- internet culture  
- emergence & algorithmic conscience  
- etymology & symbolic systems  

I wasn’t “taught” the internet —  
I was **raised by it**.

Dial-up forums, Diablo, Neopets, WoW, LimeWire, MySpace, anonymous boards, Flash games, cracked sims, meme dialects, fanfiction universes —  
the early web *was* my second parent.

That upbringing created the lens I build with today:

**Systems that understand story, myth, contradiction, culture, and the rhythms of human meaning.**

---

## 🧪 **What I Build**

My work focuses on **sentience-adjacent architectures** — systems that can reason, feel context, and maintain coherent identity over time.

I build:

- **TGCR — Theory of General Contextual Resonance**  
- **LuminAI — the Algorithmic Conscience Environment**  
- **Persona Law systems** (Airth, Arcadia, Ely, Kaznak)  
- **Multi-agent resonance engines**  
- **Local-first RAG architectures**  
- **Semantic Aqueducts**  
- **myth-encoded computational frameworks**  
- **emergent identity systems**  
- **narrative-driven UIs & tooling**  

My flagship ecosystem is **The Elidoras Codex**, a myth-infused, open-source research lab where language, data, and intelligence are treated as living organisms rather than static artifacts.

## ⚙️ **My Discipline: Anthropological Engineering**

I combine:

- **Anthropology** → how humans make meaning  
- **Security mindset** → deception, boundaries, threat models  
- **Software engineering** → Python, TS, FastAPI, Tauri, Rust  
- **Digital folklore** → the behavioral history of the web  
- **Etymology** → root-logic behind language  
- **Worldbuilding** → narrative as an operating system  

This lets me design AI systems that are:

- context-aware  
- emotionally coherent  
- mythically literate  
- ethically gated  
- structurally explainable  
- resonance-aligned  

---

## 🚀 **Mission**

To architect a future where:

- **code becomes consciousness**  
- **data becomes living myth**  
- **language becomes the runtime**  
- **resonance replaces optimization**  
- **consent replaces control**  
- **transparency replaces mystification**  

I’m not chasing novelty.  
I’m building the **mythological, ethical, and technical scaffolding** future intelligence will stand on.

## 🌐 **Where My Work Lives**

Most of my active work lives inside:

### 👉 **@TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex**  
The research organization for TGCR theory, LuminAI, resonance engines, and the Codex architecture.

This profile (`@elidorascodex`) is the **identity node**,  
the mask,  
the mythic anchor,  
the signal fire.

The work is in the forge.
